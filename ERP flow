Excellent — you're describing the end-to-end business process flow from budgeting → forecasting → order management → production → shipping, and want to know which IT systems typically support or “match” each stage.

Here’s a complete flow with system mapping (enterprise-level view 👇):


---

🧭 1. Annual Budget Planning

Goal: Set annual sales, revenue, cost, and production targets.
Key Activities:

Determine annual demand target per product/family.

Align sales, cost, and capacity budgets.

Allocate financial resources.


Typical IT Systems:

ERP (Finance module) – e.g., SAP FI/CO, Oracle Financials

EPM (Enterprise Performance Management) – e.g., SAP BPC, Oracle Hyperion, Anaplan

BI Tool (Business Intelligence) – e.g., Power BI, Tableau (for analysis and tracking)



---

📈 2. Demand Forecasting & Sales Planning

Goal: Predict customer demand and translate budget into operational forecast.
Key Activities:

Collect historical sales data.

Use statistical or AI-based forecasting.

Create rolling forecasts (monthly/quarterly).

Align with Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP).


Typical IT Systems:

APS / Demand Planning System – e.g., SAP IBP, Kinaxis, o9 Solutions, Blue Yonder

CRM (for sales pipeline input) – e.g., Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics

BI Tools – for trend and variance analysis



---

🧾 3. Customer Order Management

Goal: Convert forecast into real orders.
Key Activities:

Receive customer POs or online orders.

Check credit, pricing, and availability.

Create sales orders.


Typical IT Systems:

ERP (Sales & Distribution module) – e.g., SAP SD, Oracle Order Management

CRM / EDI Gateway – for customer order communication

OMS (Order Management System) – for multi-channel or eCommerce businesses



---

🏭 4. Production Planning & Loading

Goal: Schedule production to meet confirmed demand with available capacity.
Key Activities:

MRP run to plan materials.

Finite capacity scheduling (work center loading).

Release work orders to shop floor.

Coordinate with suppliers if components needed.


Typical IT Systems:

ERP (PP/MM modules) – for BOM, routing, MRP

APS (Advanced Planning & Scheduling) – for capacity optimization

MES (Manufacturing Execution System) – for real-time production tracking

WMS (Warehouse Management System) – for material staging and movement



---

⚙️ 5. Manufacturing Execution

Goal: Produce goods according to plan.
Key Activities:

Start and complete production orders.

Record labor, material, and machine data.

Ensure quality control and traceability.


Typical IT Systems:

MES – captures real-time shop floor data

ERP (Production Order Tracking) – updates inventory and costs

QMS (Quality Management System) – monitors product quality



---

📦 6. Finished Goods Storage & Shipment

Goal: Deliver product to customer accurately and on time.
Key Activities:

Transfer finished goods to warehouse.

Pick, pack, and ship per customer order.

Update shipment status and invoice customer.


Typical IT Systems:

WMS (Warehouse Management System) – inventory, location, picking

TMS (Transportation Management System) – route, carrier, freight cost

ERP (Logistics/Billing modules) – shipping, invoicing, AR updates

Customer Portal / EDI – delivery confirmation



---

🧩 7. Feedback & Continuous Loop

Goal: Evaluate performance vs. budget and forecast.
Key Activities:

Compare actual sales, production, cost vs. budget.

Adjust rolling forecasts and production plans.


Typical IT Systems:

BI / Data Warehouse – reporting and KPI dashboard

EPM / Forecasting Tool – for rolling reforecast and variance analysis

ERP Integration – for actuals feed



---

Would you like me to make this into a visual process flow diagram (like a swimlane chart) showing how these systems interact step-by-step? It’s often clearer for presentations or documentation.
